# TwitchSpammer

TwitchSpammer was made to make it easier and faster to communicate in twitch chat. It was originally intended as a proof of concept of how to send a message from an external application to the chat, 
but later grew into a program with numerous features that can improve the chatting experience. Some of these features are:

* Automatic emote downloads - Download the latest emotes automatically.
* Emote list - Can't remember all emote names? This is for you.
* Fast emote - Click an emote and it is instantly sent to chat.
* Filter emotes - Too many emotes? Filter them away.
* Themes - Want a light or dark theme? It's there. Also, new themes are downloaded automatically.
* Customize message - Build you message before sending it.
* Save custom messages - Have some spicy copy pasta? Save it for later.
* Instant custom message - Send you copy pasta in one click.
* "Spam mode" - Customize how you want your message to be sent.
